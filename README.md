# Binomial-Model
Here, we will implement the CRR binomial model to price European and American puts and calls on a stock paying continuous dividend yield:
Binomial(Option,K,T,S_0,σ,r,q,N,Exercies)
Where Option=C for calls and Option=P for puts, K is the strike price, T is the time to maturity, S_0 is the initial stock price, σ is the volatility, r is the continuous compounding risk free interest rate, q is the continuous dividend yield, N is the number of time steps, and Exercies=A for American options while Exercies=E for European options.
